this project will utilize basic html structure to create a simple recipe website.

(post project log) I have become more comfortable with heading tags, paragraph tags to bring text down a space, lists, anchor tags and images. one mistake I made was using spaces when first naming my files which I had to go back and rename after the fact. it would seem that a "'" character would indicate spaces are involved in a file name within terminal.
